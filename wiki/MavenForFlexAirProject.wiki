#summary Maven Project for Flex AIR, Pure MVC, Spring ActionScript, and Flex Unit.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

I worked on a Flex AIR project with Pure MVC, Spring ActionScript, and Flex Unit 4 recently, which was not a very pleasant experience. Many Flex projects use ant for build and Flex Air project is even more difficult to maventize. I post my experiences on the Flex AIR Maven project and hope it saves some people's time. 

= Prerequisites =

  * _Flex SDK 3_. Download Flex 3 SDK from [http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3 Adobe site]. Unpack it and then set up the FLEX_HOME environment variable.

  * _Flex AIR_. Downloaded the AIR from [http://get.adobe.com/air/ Adobe AIR site] and install it. Windows installation is easy and more details of Linux installation could be found from my previous post [http://code.google.com/p/jianwikis/wiki/InstallAIRonFedora11#Adobe_Air Install Adobe AIR, BlazDS, and Blaze Monster on Fedora 11].

  * _Maven_. Download Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html. If you never installed Maven before, please follow [http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation the official Maven Installation Guide].
