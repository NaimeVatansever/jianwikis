= Introduction =

I worked on a Flex AIR project with Pure MVC, Spring ActionScript, and Flex Unit 4 recently, which was not a very pleasant experience. Many Flex projects use ant for build and Flex Air project is even more difficult to maventize. I post my experiences on the Flex AIR Maven project and hope it saves some people's time.
