This article will introduce how to configure Tomcat to support SSL connection with Apr. The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) based Native library for Tomcat is used to optimize tomcat performance.

== Tomcat SSL without APR ==

Without APR, you can put everything into Java key store and the configuration is simple. You should turn on the SSL connector in server.xml as follows,

{{{
 <Connector port="8443"
     maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
     enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
     acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
     clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
     keystoreFile="conf/keystore.jks" keystorePass="keystore_password"
     truststoreFile="conf/truststore.jks" truststorePass="truststore_password"/>
}}}
