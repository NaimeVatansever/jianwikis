= Introduction =

Recently, I work on a warehouse optimization project. On interesting problem is to select an optimal pick tour for the pick agent, which is very much like a simplified path planning problem in a game world. I used the popular [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm A`*` search algorithm] and like to share with you about my Java implementation of the A`*` algorithm.
