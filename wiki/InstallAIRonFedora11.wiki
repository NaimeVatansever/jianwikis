#summary Install Adobe AIR on Fedora 11.
#labels Phase-Support

I downloaded the AIR from

http://get.adobe.com/air/

and made the file executable

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# chmod +x AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
}}}

Then, tried to install it

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
}}}

However, it threw the following error:

{{{
"Adobe AIR could not be installed. Either gnome-keyring or Kwallet must be installed prior to installing Adobe AIR."
}}}

It also had errors such as

{{{
"Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "pk-gtk-module": libpk-gtk-module.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "gnomebreakpad": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
}}}

The above errors were for the AIR installer and you do not really need to fix them. If you want to, you can use yum to find the appropriate RPMs, such as,

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# yum provides */libpk-gtk-module.so

Since the AIR is 32 bit, you need to install the 32 bit version of PackageKit-gtk-module, i.e.,

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# yum install PackageKit-gtk-module-0.4.6-8.fc11.i586
}}}

Go back the original error, seems I missed the gnome-keyring RPM, installed it as follows,

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# yum install gnome-keyring.i586
}}}

Because AIR is for 32 bits, I had to install the 32 bit version even I am on 64 bit Linux.

Tried to install the AIR again

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
}}}

This time, it threw a different error:

{{{
"An error occurred while installing Adobe AIR. Installation may not be allowed by your administrator. Please contact your administrator."
}}}

Really strange, because I used the user root to install. Did some Google search again and found some hints from

http://rootblock.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/fedora-11-adobe-air-installation-not-allowed-by-administrator/

Seems the actual reason is that I missed a lot of dependencies. The suggested solution is to install the following RPMS:

{{{
yum -y install xterm gtk2-devel gnome-keyring libxml2-devel libxslt rpm-devel nss
}}}

But I am on 64 bit Linux, the default RPMs are 64 bits, thus, I need to use 32 bit versions instead. As a result, I installed the following RPMs:

{{{
yum -y install xterm.i586 gtk2-devel.i586 gnome-keyring.i586 libxml2-devel.i586 libxslt.i586 rpm-devel.i586 nss.i586
}}}

Retried again,

{{{
[root@Mars ~]# ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
}}}

This time, no error was thrown.
